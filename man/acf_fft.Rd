\title{Fast Autocovariance and Autocorrelation Calculation Using FFT}
\usage{
acf_fft(Y, Tt, lag = NULL, pad = TRUE, bias_correction = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size IxT where I is the number of time series (rows) and T is their length (columns).
Each row is treated as an individual time series.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. The number of datapoints in the timeseries. Is always used for sanity checking.}

\item{lag}{Optional integer vector of lags to return (not used in current implementation).}

\item{pad}{Logical. If TRUE (default), zero-pads time series to next power of two for improved FFT performance.}

\item{bias_correction}{Logical. If TRUE (default), applies unbiased lag-dependent normalization (scales by N / (N - k) at lag k) to match R's `acf(..., type = "correlation")`.}
}
\value{
A list with:
  - `acov`: Autocovariance matrix of size IxTt (unbiased if `bias_correction = TRUE`).
  - `acor`: Autocorrelation matrix of size IxTt (normalized by variance at lag 0).
}
\description{
Computes autocovariance and autocorrelation functions efficiently for multiple time series using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Optionally applies zero-padding for performance optimization and unbiased lag-specific normalization to match R's `acf()` behavior.
}
\details{
This function uses the Wienerâ€“Khinchin theorem to compute autocovariance/autocorrelation via the FFT.
The FFT implementation assumes periodic extension; proper bias correction ensures equivalence to the sample autocovariance
definition used in R's `acf()` function.

If `pad = TRUE`, time series are explicitly zero-padded to length `2^nextpow2(2*T - 1)` to avoid wrap-around effects and optimize FFT speed.
If `bias_correction = TRUE`, autocovariance estimates at lag k are rescaled by N / (N - k) to correct for the reduction in number of terms at larger lags.

set.seed(123)
Y <- matrix(stats::rnorm(500), nrow = 5, ncol = 100)  # 5 time series of length 100
result <- acf_fft(Y, Tt = 100, pad = TRUE, bias_correction = TRUE)
print(result$acor)
print(result$acov)
