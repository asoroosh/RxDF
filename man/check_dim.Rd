\title{Ensure Correct Dimensionality of Time Series Data. It ensures matrics are
number of data points x number of time series.}
\usage{
check_dim(Y, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric vector (length Tt) or matrix (with Tt rows or Tt columns).}

\item{Tt}{Integer. The expected length of each time series (i.e., the number of time points).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with \code{Tt} rows. If \code{Y} was a vector, it is converted
to a matrix with one column. If \code{Y} is a matrix with \code{Tt} columns but
not \code{Tt} rows, it is transposed.
}
\description{
This utility function checks and standardizes the input \code{Y} to ensure it has
the expected time series length \code{Tt} as rows. It accepts either a vector
(single time series) or a matrix (multiple time series).
}
\examples{
check_dim(1:100, 100)              # returns 100x1 matrix
check_dim(matrix(rnorm(300), 100), 100)  # returns 100x3 matrix

}
