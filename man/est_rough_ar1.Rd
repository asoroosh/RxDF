\title{Estimate AR(1) Coefficients Using a Rough Moment-Based Estimator}
\usage{
est_rough_ar1(Y, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric vector (single time series) or matrix (multiple series), where
each column is a time series of length \code{Tt}.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. The expected length (number of time points) of each time series.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of estimated AR(1) coefficients, one per column of \code{Y}.
}
\description{
Computes rough estimates of AR(1) coefficients for one or more time series using
a simplified moment-based formula:
\deqn{\hat{\phi} = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^{T} Y_{t-1} Y_t}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} Y_t^2}}
This method is fast and suitable for simulations but does not correspond to
the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Use with caution for inference.
}
\details{
If \code{Y} is a vector, it is first converted into a matrix with one column.
If \code{Y} is not in column-wise format, an attempt is made to transpose it
so that each column corresponds to a time series of length \code{Tt}.
}
\examples{
Y <- sim_many_ts_same_ar1(100, 0.6, 10)
est_rough_ar1(Y, 100)
