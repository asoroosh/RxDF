\title{Apply Tukey Taper to Rows of a Matrix}
\usage{
tukey_taper_me(acs, Tt, M = sqrt(Tt))
}
\arguments{
\item{acs}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size \verb{I × Tt}, where \code{I} is the number of time series (rows)
and \code{Tt} is the number of lags (columns). Each row is treated as an independent sequence.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of lags (columns). Used to check consistency and ensure correct orientation.}

\item{M}{Integer. Length of the taper window. The Tukey taper will be applied over columns 1 to \code{M}.
Columns \code{M+1} to \code{Tt} are set to zero.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimension as \code{acs} (\verb{I × Tt}), where each row has been multiplied by
the Tukey taper in columns 1 to \code{M}, and zeros elsewhere.
}
\description{
Applies a Tukey taper window to each row of a matrix \code{acs}, independently, over the first \code{M} columns (lags).
After column \code{M}, all values are set to zero. This is typically used to smooth autocorrelation or cross-correlation
sequences to reduce variance from high lags.
}
\details{
The Tukey taper weights applied are defined as:
\deqn{
  w(m) = \frac{1 + \cos(m \pi / M)}{2}, \quad m = 1, 2, \dots, M
}

The taper smoothly down-weights larger lags, which is useful when estimating quantities like
effective degrees of freedom in correlated data.
