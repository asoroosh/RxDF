\title{Apply Tukey Taper to Rows of a Matrix}
\usage{
tukey_taper_me(acs, Tt, M = sqrt(Tt))
}
\arguments{
\item{acs}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size `I × Tt`, where `I` is the number of time series (rows)
and `Tt` is the number of lags (columns). Each row is treated as an independent sequence.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of lags (columns). Used to check consistency and ensure correct orientation.}

\item{M}{Integer. Length of the taper window. The Tukey taper will be applied over columns 1 to `M`.
Columns `M+1` to `Tt` are set to zero.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimension as `acs` (`I × Tt`), where each row has been multiplied by
the Tukey taper in columns 1 to `M`, and zeros elsewhere.
}
\description{
Applies a Tukey taper window to each row of a matrix `acs`, independently, over the first `M` columns (lags).
After column `M`, all values are set to zero. This is typically used to smooth autocorrelation or cross-correlation
sequences to reduce variance from high lags.
}
\details{
The Tukey taper weights applied are defined as:
\deqn{
  w(m) = \frac{1 + \cos(m \pi / M)}{2}, \quad m = 1, 2, \dots, M
}

The taper smoothly down-weights larger lags, which is useful when estimating quantities like
effective degrees of freedom in correlated data.
