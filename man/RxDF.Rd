\title{Robust variance estimation for correlated time series network}
\usage{
RxDF(Y, Tt, truncate = "adaptive", verbose = TRUE, TVflag = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of dimension `nn Ã— Tt`, where rows represent time series
and columns represent timepoints.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of timepoints (columns of `Y`).}

\item{truncate}{Either `"adaptive"` for adaptive truncation based on significance
of autocorrelations, or a numeric scalar specifying fixed truncation lag `M`.
Default is `"adaptive"`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), prints progress and diagnostics.}

\item{TVflag}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), enforces minimum variance equal to
textbook white noise variance when autocorrelation-adjusted variance falls below it.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
  \item{VarHatRho}{Matrix of robust variance estimates for all pairs of correlations
  (diagonal set to 0).}
  \item{Stat}{List containing:
    \describe{
      \item{z}{Matrix of Fisher-transformed z-statistics for each correlation.}
      \item{p}{Matrix of two-sided p-values corresponding to `z`.}
      \item{TV}{Matrix of textbook variance estimates under white noise assumption.}
      \item{EVE}{Indices of pairs where autocorrelation-adjusted variance was smaller
      than textbook variance (only if `TVflag = TRUE`).}
      \item{W2S}{Matrix of truncation lags used for each pair (only if `truncate = "adaptive"`).}
    }
  }
}
}
\description{
Computes a robust estimator of the variance of correlation coefficients
between multiple standardized time series, adjusting for serial correlation
and cross-correlation effects using an analytic formula.
Supports adaptive or fixed truncation strategies to curb influence from
high-lag autocorrelations.
}
\details{
The method uses fast FFT-based computation of autocovariances and cross-covariances
and implements the analytic formula proposed in Afyouni et al. (2019) for estimating
variance inflation due to autocorrelation structure.
