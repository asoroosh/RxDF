\title{Demean a matrix along rows or columns}
\usage{
demean_ts(Y, dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix. The data matrix to demean.
Rows or columns represent separate time series depending on the \code{dim} argument.}

\item{dim}{Integer. Direction along which to demean:
\itemize{
\item \code{dim = 1}: demean columns (subtract mean of each column),
\item \code{dim = 2}: demean rows (subtract mean of each row, default).
}}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{Y} with means removed along the specified dimension.
}
\description{
Removes the mean from each row or column of a matrix \code{Y}.
This is useful for centering time series prior to further processing (e.g., autocorrelation, FFT).
The dimension along which demeaning is performed is controlled by the \code{dim} argument.
}
\details{
If \code{dim = 1}, each column is centered so that its mean is zero.
If \code{dim = 2}, each row is centered so that its mean is zero.
An error is raised if \code{dim} is not 1 or 2.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(12), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
demean_ts(Y, dim = 1)  # Demean columns
demean_ts(Y, dim = 2)  # Demean rows

}
