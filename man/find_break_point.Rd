\title{Find breakpoint where autocorrelation becomes insignificant}
\usage{
find_break_point(acs, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{acs}{Numeric vector of length `Tt`. The autocorrelation sequence (lags 1 to `Tt`).}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Total number of lags. Used for consistency check and orientation.}
}
\value{
Integer scalar `where2stop` indicating the largest lag before autocorrelation
becomes insignificant:
- If all autocorrelations are significant ⇒ returns `Tt`.
- If autocorrelation is insignificant from the start ⇒ returns 0.
- Otherwise ⇒ returns index of last significant lag before first insignificance.
}
\description{
Determines the lag index at which the absolute autocorrelation sequence first falls
below an approximate 95% confidence bound for white noise. This identifies where
autocorrelation ceases to be statistically significant and can serve as a heuristic
cutoff for truncating or tapering.
}
\details{
The threshold for significance is defined as:
\deqn{
  \text{bound} = \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{Tt}}
}
corresponding to the 95% confidence bound for white noise autocorrelations.

The function checks when `|acs| <= bound` and reports the first lag where this occurs,
then returns `where2stop` as the lag immediately preceding that point.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
acs <- acf(rnorm(100), plot = FALSE, lag.max = 30)$acf[-1]  # Exclude lag 0
find_break_point(acs, 30)
