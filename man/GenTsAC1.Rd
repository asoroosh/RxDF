\title{Generate a Time Series with First-Order Autoregressive Correlation}
\usage{
GenTsAC1(ar1, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{ar1}{Numeric. The first-order autoregressive coefficient. Must be between -1 and 1 for stationarity.}

\item{ndpr}{Integer. The number of time points in the generated time series. Must be a positive integer.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{ndpr}, representing the generated time series.
}
\description{
This function generates a time series with first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) correlation.
}
\examples{
# Generate an AR(1) time series with coefficient 0.8 and 100 time points
ts <- GenTsAC1(0.8, 100)
plot(ts, type = "l", main = "Generated AR(1) Time Series", ylab = "Value", xlab = "Time")

# Generate a white noise series with AR(1) coefficient 0
ts_white_noise <- GenTsAC1(0, 50)
