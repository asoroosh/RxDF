\title{Pairwise Timeseries Product Matrix}
\usage{
ProdMat(Y0, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y0}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size \verb{Tt × n} or \verb{n × Tt}, where \code{Tt} is the number
of timepoints and \code{n} is the number of timeseries. The function transposes \code{Y0} internally
if needed to ensure rows represent timepoints.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of timepoints (\code{Tt} should match one dimension of \code{Y0}).}
}
\value{
A 3D array of dimensions \verb{n × n × Tt}. For each timepoint \code{t}, the slice \code{PM0[ , , t]}
contains the element-wise products of all pairs of timeseries at timepoint \code{t}.
The matrix is symmetric for each timepoint, and diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\description{
Computes a 3D array containing the element-wise products of all pairs of timeseries
in a matrix \code{Y0}. For each timepoint, this function calculates the product of each pair
of timeseries values at that timepoint and stores them in a symmetric 2D matrix slice.
The diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(5 * 100), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
PM0 <- ProdMat(Y, 100)
dim(PM0)  # 5 x 5 x 100
