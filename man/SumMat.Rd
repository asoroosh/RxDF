\title{Pairwise Timeseries Sum Matrix}
\usage{
SumMat(Y0, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y0}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size `Tt × n` or `n × Tt`, where `Tt` is the number
of timepoints and `n` is the number of timeseries. The function transposes `Y0` internally
if needed to ensure rows represent timepoints.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of timepoints (`Tt` should match one dimension of `Y0`).}
}
\value{
A 3D array of dimensions `n × n × Tt`. For each timepoint `t`, the slice `SM0[ , , t]`
contains the element-wise sums of all pairs of timeseries at timepoint `t`.
The matrix is symmetric for each timepoint, and diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\description{
Computes a 3D array containing the element-wise sums of all unique pairs of timeseries
in a matrix `Y0`. For each timepoint, this function calculates the sum of each pair
of timeseries values at that timepoint and stores them in a symmetric 2D matrix slice.
The diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\details{
- `SM0[i, j, t]` gives `Y0[t, i] + Y0[t, j]` for `i ≠ j`.
- `SM0[i, i, t]` is explicitly set to 0 for all `i` and `t`.
- Intended for fast computation of pairwise sums across all timeseries and timepoints.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(5 * 100), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
SM0 <- SumMat(Y, 100)
dim(SM0)  # 5 x 5 x 100
