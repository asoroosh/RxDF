\title{Pairwise Timeseries Sum Matrix}
\usage{
SumMat(Y0, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y0}{Numeric matrix. A matrix of size \verb{Tt × n} or \verb{n × Tt}, where \code{Tt} is the number
of timepoints and \code{n} is the number of timeseries. The function transposes \code{Y0} internally
if needed to ensure rows represent timepoints.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of timepoints (\code{Tt} should match one dimension of \code{Y0}).}
}
\value{
A 3D array of dimensions \verb{n × n × Tt}. For each timepoint \code{t}, the slice \code{SM0[ , , t]}
contains the element-wise sums of all pairs of timeseries at timepoint \code{t}.
The matrix is symmetric for each timepoint, and diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\description{
Computes a 3D array containing the element-wise sums of all unique pairs of timeseries
in a matrix \code{Y0}. For each timepoint, this function calculates the sum of each pair
of timeseries values at that timepoint and stores them in a symmetric 2D matrix slice.
The diagonal elements are set to zero.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{SM0[i, j, t]} gives \code{Y0[t, i] + Y0[t, j]} for \verb{i ≠ j}.
\item \code{SM0[i, i, t]} is explicitly set to 0 for all \code{i} and \code{t}.
\item Intended for fast computation of pairwise sums across all timeseries and timepoints.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(5 * 100), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
SM0 <- SumMat(Y, 100)
dim(SM0)  # 5 x 5 x 100
