\title{Simulate Multiple AR(1) Time Series with Shared Coefficient}
\usage{
sim_many_ts_same_ar1(Tt, phi, n_series)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tt}{Integer. Number of time points in each simulated time series.}

\item{phi}{Numeric. AR(1) coefficient (typically between -1 and 1 for stationarity).}

\item{n_series}{Integer. Number of independent AR(1) series to simulate.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimensions `Tt` x `n_series`, where each column
        corresponds to one simulated AR(1) time series.
}
\description{
Generates multiple independent realisations of an AR(1) (autoregressive of order 1)
time series, each of length `Tt` and with the same autoregressive coefficient `phi`.
Each series is initialized with a standard normal value and evolves according to:
\deqn{Y_t = \phi Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)}
}
\examples{
sim_many_ts_same_ar1(Tt = 100, phi = 0.7, n_series = 50)

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{sim_ar1}} for simulating a single AR(1) process.
