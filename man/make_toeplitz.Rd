\title{Create a Toeplitz Matrix with Specified Off-Diagonal Entries}
\usage{
make_toeplitz(sigX, Tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigX}{Numeric vector. The off-diagonal entries to fill the Toeplitz matrix.}

\item{Tt}{Integer. The desired size of the Toeplitz matrix (number of rows and columns).}
}
\value{
A numeric Toeplitz matrix of dimensions `ndp x ndp` with the specified structure:
- The main diagonal is filled with 1s.
- The first sub- and super-diagonals are filled with the first element of `sigX`,
  the second sub- and super-diagonals with the second element of `sigX`, and so on.
- Any remaining diagonals are filled with 0 if `sigX` is shorter than `ndp - 1`.
}
\description{
This function generates a Toeplitz matrix of a specified size, where the main diagonal
is filled with 1s, and the off-diagonal entries are specified by a given vector. If the
matrix size exceeds the length of the vector, the remaining entries are set to 0.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Create a 5x5 Toeplitz matrix with specified off-diagonal values
sigX <- c(0.6, 0.3, 0.2)
make_toeplitz(sigX, 5)

# Example 2: Create a larger Toeplitz matrix (10x10) with the same off-diagonal values
make_toeplitz(sigX, 10)
