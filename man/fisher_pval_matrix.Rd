\title{Compute Two-Tailed P-Values from a Correlation Matrix via Fisher Z-Transform}
\usage{
fisher_pval_matrix(netmat, R2Zcrt)
}
\arguments{
\item{netmat}{A numeric matrix representing pairwise correlation coefficients
(typically symmetric, with values between -1 and 1).}

\item{R2Zcrt}{Numeric. A correction factor to scale the Fisher-transformed values
(e.g., \eqn{\sqrt{df - 3}} where `df` is the degrees of freedom).}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as `netmat`, containing two-tailed
        p-values for each correlation.
}
\description{
Applies the Fisher Z-transformation to a correlation matrix and computes
two-tailed p-values for testing the null hypothesis that each correlation
coefficient is zero.
}
\details{
The Fisher Z-transformation is applied as \eqn{Z = \text{atanh}(r) \cdot R2Zcrt},
where \eqn{r} is the raw correlation. Two-tailed p-values are then computed as:
\deqn{p = 2 \cdot \Phi(-|Z|)}
where \eqn{\Phi} is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
mat <- matrix(rnorm(100*10), 100, 10)
corr_mat <- cor(mat)
pvals <- fisher_pval_matrix(corr_mat, sqrt(97))  # df = 100 - 3
